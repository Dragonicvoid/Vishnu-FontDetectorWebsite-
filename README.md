This is a laravel project which is a website that detecs font from a picture and save that data to the server if you are log on.

note : 
1. we didnt do much as to put resources to this project yet. Since we still researching on how to put image to our PHP Server. this is some of the resources:

 - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_fileupload.asp
2. for the font detection we willbe using Vasile Peste 's Typefont that uses java script and JSON :
